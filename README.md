I am Philip. Writing about myself has never come easily, mostly because I am still discovering who I am. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayophilip/) covers what I do. This space is more about what drives me.

But what makes me me? What am I really about? It is the relationships I choose to invest in.

I learned early that showing up matters. Watching a single parent quietly carry responsibility shaped how I approach people today. With curiosity, reliability, and a bias toward being useful. If someone needs help, I tend to lean in before I overthink it. That instinct has led to marriage, friendships and a few late night decisions that turned into long term connections.

My interests reflect the same evolution. I have learned to let go of things that drain me and lean into what gives energy back. Books keep me grounded and curious. Music keeps my mood honest. Markets and data keep me humble and patient. What I focus on evolves, but the pattern stays the same. I like pursuits that reward attention and long term thinking.

My relationship with work and ideas has also matured. I have had setbacks, moments of doubt, and stretches of growth that felt earned the hard way. Each one clarified what I value now. Learning (immediate application of knowledge), self awareness, and the ability to communicate clearly. Lately, that has meant getting more comfortable speaking in public and saying what I mean without hiding behind 'tech-speak' or jargon. That's one of the reasons I started this blog.

So, about me? I am shaped by the people I show up for, the ideas I wrestle with, and the habits I keep refining. And I am still very much a work in progress.
