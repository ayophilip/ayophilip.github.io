        <li>Wrote the logic that explores possible ways over-clustering exists in the CDP. It helps better communicate with stakeholders about the limitations of the CDP and think about areas of improvement in the stitch process. For instance, the CDP stitches accounts together using mostly their PII. However, this may not be enough because some accounts share the same PII but different purchase behaviors. Should behavioural data be used as a separation key that breaks the cluster?</li>
        <li>Built some deck with respect to the results I surfaced. To be presented on Wednesday</li>
